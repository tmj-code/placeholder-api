# placeholder-api
Demonstration of how to create your own placeholder api in just a few minutes.

## How to use it

Start the application, which launches a browser displaying the Swagger UI. Yo can now interact with the API through Swagger, or through any client, including a Single Page Application, a Mobile App, and more.

## How to adapt it to your needs

To make it your own, you need to do the following.

1. Change the placeholder data in the posts.json file (and possibly change the file name to match).

2. Change the class Post to match your data (tip: Copy the JSON, switch to Program.cs, then go to the menu Edit > Paste Special > Paste JSON as Classes)

3. Change the endpoints to suit your needs.

And DONE! You now have your very own placeholder API, with data that reacts to your changes (at least until the API is restarted).
